# DistractBlock
===============
Study Aid Extension for Chrome

==============================

ISSUES:
======
* Text flashes when it refreshes for the intervals - seems to be fixed?
-- This is ironically distracting..

* If a site is blocked by both the single block and the list it is counted as 2 sites

* Icon turns to inactive state on first interval check (sometimes)

POSSIBLE UPDATES:
=================
* Swap out drop down box with alarm clock type selection
